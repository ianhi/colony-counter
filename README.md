### Development

To build and see result in the colony-counter folder run the following commands:
```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```
now open the `index.html` file


### Continuous updates
In one terminal run `yarn watch` and it should watch for file changes and compile everytime you save. You will then need to refresh the page in your browser.

### Checking lint:
`yarn eslint`
